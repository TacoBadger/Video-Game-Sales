## Motivation
We will now use Microsoft SQL to practice my Data Analysis with this public dataset,again it is okay to work with just one tool but for us we will be practicing in different tools to expand our knowledge, it is not required but you can always choose yourself.

This practice is done with the use of [Microsoft SQL Management Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports a wide variety of transaction

We will also be practicing our [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) dashboard skills with this dataset.
